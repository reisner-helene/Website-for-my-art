# Website-for-my-art

I started painting when the lockdown started to cheer my friends up, this is the website I made to share the art with more people. It was created in Saturday morning workshops teaching women to code.

I was doing a JavaScript course at a local evening school, so this is also the final project for this course.

The website is available at https://reisner-helene.github.io/artwebsite/.
